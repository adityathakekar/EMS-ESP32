to do
=====

Platform/Interface:
 - To Fix: TextField validating numbers when empty giving warning "The specified value "NaN" cannot be parsed, or is out of range."

 - Question: AccessPoint - noticed there is Preferred Channel, Hide SSID options, Max Clients. back-end code needed?
 - Question: build is bigger than pre-hooks?
 - Question: why using react-router-dom v5.3 instead of v6?

 - Enhancement: Can the screen be refreshed after an upload?
 - Enhancement: Web Socket ping back to the server (ESP) to see if it's still alive and try and reconnect
 - Enhancement: Flashing of "Loading..." only if it takes too long to refresh?

EMS-ESP:
 - Enhancement: reload sensor in Dashboard after rename, same with thermostat
 - Finish System Log - Get formatting/styling working, add form settings

to do later
===========
- EMS-ESP: add ethernet params to the EMS-ESP settings, change phy_type
- create an useEs.ts (like useWs.ts)
